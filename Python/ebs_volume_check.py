# //
# The purpose of the above code is to modify the type of an Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume to gp3 (General Purpose SSD) when triggered by an AWS CloudWatch event. 
# 
# Here's a detailed breakdown:

# Purpose:
# 1) Trigger Source: The code is designed to be triggered by a CloudWatch event. 
# This event includes details about an EBS volume (specified in the resources field of the event object).
# 2) EBS Volume Type Change: It extracts the EBS volume ID from the event and uses the AWS EC2 service (boto3 library) to change the type of the volume to gp3.
# 
# Use Case:
# This could be part of an automation workflow where:
# An EBS volume (e.g., standard or gp2) needs to be upgraded or optimized to the newer gp3 type for better performance or cost-efficiency.
# CloudWatch events monitor resources and trigger the Lambda function whenever a specific event occurs (e.g., volume creation or modification).
# Workflow:
# Input Event: The function receives an event containing details about an AWS resource (an EBS volume).
# Volume ID Extraction: The ARN of the EBS volume is parsed to extract the volume ID.
# Volume Modification: The function uses the modify_volume API to update the volume's type to gp3.
# Logging: The function logs key actions (e.g., extracted volume ID and API response) for debugging or auditing purposes.

# ## Example Scenario:
# Suppose an organization has an automation policy where all newly created EBS volumes must be converted to gp3 for cost savings and improved performance. 
# The Lambda function listens for CloudWatch events (e.g., volume creation events) and ensures this conversion happens automatically without manual intervention.
